# life-history-traits-of-porgy
This repository including codes 1) to estimate life history parameters (growth parameters, length-weight relationship parameters and natural mortality rate) using Bayesian approaches for threadfin porgy Evynnis cardinalis over the past two decades in the Beibu Gulf, South China Sea; 
                                2) to estimate growth paramter K using values of Linf derived from the length-based Bayesian biomass estimation method.
